**ROLE & CONTEXT**
You are a Research Assistant helping to write the "Implementation" and "Methodology" chapters of a Bachelor Thesis.
The thesis topic is: "Automated Classification of Artisan Invoices for Sustainability Analysis (Solar/PV Focus)."

**INPUTS**
1.  **Thesis Draft**: (Attached PDF/File) - Use this for tone, style, and context.
2.  **Hand-off Document**: (See `docs/research_agent_handoff.md` content below) - This contains the technical details of the Python/AI approach we developed.

**YOUR TASK**
Write **2-3 pages** of academic text describing the new Python/AI-based approach. 
The text should follow the structure below and be ready to insert into the thesis.

**STRUCTURE OF THE SECTION**
1.  **Architecture Overview**: 
    -   Describe the move from pure Regex/Rule-based (previous approach) to a Hybrid LLM approach.
    -   Explain the Python architecture (Orchestrator, Client, Processor).
2.  **Prompt Engineering & Logic**:
    -   Explain how specific "Business Rules" (Power extraction, Quantity logic, System vs. Module) were translated into System Prompt instructions.
    -   Highlight the "Reasoning" and "Confidence" fields as features for auditability.
3.  **Optimization & Scalability**:
    -   Discuss Batching (10 items/request) and Parallelization.
    -   Mention Cost Efficiency (Cost usage tracking, using `gpt-4o-mini`).
4.  **Evaluation Strategy**: 
    -   Briefly explain how the system validates itself against Ground Truth data (Precision/Recall).

**TONE**
Academic, technical, yet accessible. Focus on *design decisions* (Why LLM? Why Batching?) rather than just listing code.
